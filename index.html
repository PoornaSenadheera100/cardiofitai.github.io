            <h1>Project Scope</h1>
            <p>The aim of this research is to obtain a 12-lead ECG signal from the palms, focusing on non-invasive and easy-to-use technology. The Lead I signal is acquired using three electrodes on the palms, and deep learning techniques are utilized to reconstruct the remaining eleven ECG signals. These reconstructed signals are used to diagnose up to 20 cardiac diseases.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>The primary ECG lead, Lead I, is obtained from the palms using disposable electrodes. A modified attention U-Net deep learning model is used to reconstruct the remaining 11 ECG leads. The entire 12-lead ECG is then used as input for a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) model to diagnose 20 different cardiac diseases. This approach allows for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective cardiac screening without hospital visits.</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>Using the reconstructed 12-lead ECG, the model achieved high accuracy in diagnosing multiple cardiac conditions. The deep learning model provided a viable solution for early cardiac diagnosis, thereby helping to identify patients who need immediate medical attention.</p>

            <h1>Diet Recommendation Component</h1>
            <p>Based on the cardiac diagnosis and other health data, including blood tests and other medical reports, the system provides personalized diet recommendations. This is to ensure the user can manage their health effectively by addressing both their cardiac and general nutritional needs.</p>
